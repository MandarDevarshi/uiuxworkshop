      <p>My name is <strong>Mandar Devarshi</strong>. I have a bachelors in Computer Sciences and have worked on varied
        range of projects and jobs.
        A few years ago, I shifted my focus to the Arts specifically Western classical painting and got admitted to
        Florence Arts Academy, Italy in 2020. Sadly, it was the year of the pandemic which lead to me staying back and
        focusing on programming instead. </p>
      <p>The lessons learned from painting have taught me design and color principles which I hope to pass on to
        designers
        of the web as I have found them very handy and useful in my work with UI/UX. </p>
      <p>Moreover, for past years I have been stumbling through vast amounts of information, tutorials, books and have
        collated the essence of both the worlds without the frills and thrills that designers and developers pick up
        unwittingly. </p>
